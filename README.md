# BlueScrape

This can get the actual link of anything on BlueDrake42's site aslong as a valid URL is given. 

Currently some hiccups exist such as:
- An ad appears on the first time the script is ran, so a second run is needed.
- You cannot run this in headless mode at the moment, you have to physically copy the URL to get it.
